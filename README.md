# Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries

# Objective:
Working with scalar, correlated, and nested subqueries inside SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses.

# Tools Used: MySQL Workbench

# Concepts Practiced:
- Scalar subqueries in SELECT
- Subqueries in WHERE using IN and EXISTS
- Correlated subqueries
- Derived tables using subqueries in FROM

# SQL Queries
- Included queries for department-wise comparisons
- Filtering with EXISTS/IN based on subresults
- Advanced logic using nested conditions

# Usefullness of what we did here:
1. Correlated subqueries- To flag employees earning more than their team average.
2. IN with subquery on department-level stats- To list employees in high-performing departments.
3. scalar subqueries in SELECT- To label each employee with their department's average pay.
